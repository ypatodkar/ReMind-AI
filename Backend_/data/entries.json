The cognitive distortion present here seems to be All-or-Nothing Thinking, or polarized thinking, where you're either fully successful or a complete failure.\n  3. Let's reframe this:\n   - \"Today was productive and I've made progress. There will always be areas for improvement, but every day brings new opportunities to grow.\"\n   - \"Success is not about perfection; it's about consistent effort. Every accomplishment, no matter how small, moves me closer to my goals.\"\n   - \"I'm capable and resilient, even when I face challenges or setbacks. Tomorrow is another chance to learn and grow.\"\n4. A practical step you can take to continue your success is to reflect on what specifically made today productive. Identify the strategies that worked well for you, and aim to incorporate them into your daily routine moving forward. Celebrate your small victories and remember to practice self-compassion when faced with challenges. Progress is often a series of incremental steps rather than one giant leap.\n\n",
